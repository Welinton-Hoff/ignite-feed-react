## About the Project

**Ignite Feed React** is a React JS application designed to simulate a simple social media feed. Users can:
- View posts and comments
- Add new comments
- Leave likes on posts

Although this project does not connect to an API, it generates a few random posts and comments to simulate dynamic content.

The main goal of this project is to study the fundamentals of React and understand the basics of component management, state, and interaction in a modern frontend environment.

## Features

- View timeline posts and comments
- Add new comments to posts
- Like posts and interact with the feed
- Randomly generated posts and comments for a realistic feel

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [JavaScript (ES6+)](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Scoped and modular CSS styles
